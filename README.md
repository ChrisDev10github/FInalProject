# FinalProject
The primary aims of this project can be found within the project specification folder, and are explained in detail within the executive summary, as well as the exploratory questions. 

This project looked at data from the following sources:

U.S. Census (Financial Data), 
U.S. Small Business Administration (Disaster Loan data), 
Willden Chase (S&P 500 Data), 
U.S Department of Labor Statistics (Unemployement Data).

More information can be found within the Project Specifications folder, in the [DataSources PDF](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/Project%20Specifications/DataSources.pdf). The project management plan can also be found in this folder.

A PDF of the ETL necessary for this project can be found in the main directory, (ETL Report).
The ETL for these datasets as well as the raw data files used can be found in the code folder, containing folders for each set of data. Our Kafka consumer and producer are directly in the code folder.

Using the ETL, an ML model predicting unemployement was trained, and exported in the ML folder within the code folder.

For the visualizations summarizing our findings, we made napkin drawings that led to the creation of our powerBI report, UnemploymentReport.pbix.

The findings of our project are explained within ProjectTechnicalReport.pdf
