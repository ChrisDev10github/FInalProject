# FinalProject
The primary aims of this project can be found within the [project specification folder](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/tree/main/Project%20Specifications), and are explained in detail within the [executive summary](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/Project%20Specifications/ExecutiveSummary.pdf), as well as the [exploratory questions](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/Project%20Specifications/ExploratoryQuestions.pdf). 

This project looked at data from the following sources:

U.S. Census (Financial Data), 
U.S. Small Business Administration (Disaster Loan data), 
Willden Chase (S&P 500 Data), 
U.S Department of Labor Statistics (Unemployement Data).

More information can be found within the Project Specifications folder, in the [DataSources PDF](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/Project%20Specifications/DataSources.pdf). The project management plan can also be found in this folder.

A PDF of the ETL necessary for this project can be found in the main directory, [ETL Report](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/ETLReport.pdf).
The ETL for these datasets as well as the raw data files used can be found in the [code](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/tree/main/code) folder, containing folders for each set of data. Our Kafka [consumer](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/code/Guinea-Pigs-Consumer.ipynb) and [producer](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/code/Guinea-Pigs-Producer%20with%20left%20join.ipynb) are directly in the code folder.

Using the ETL, an ML model predicting unemployement was [trained](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/code/ML/ml-model.ipynb), and [exported](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/code/ML/finalmodel) in the code folder.

For the visualizations summarizing our findings, we made napkin drawings for [visuals](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/VisualizationsNapkinsAndFeedback.pdf) and a [dashboard](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/DashboardNapkinsAndFeedback.pdf) that led to the creation of our powerBI report, [UnemploymentReport.pbix.](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/UnemploymentReport.pbix)

The findings of our project are explained within [ProjectTechnicalReport.pdf](https://github.com/ChrisDev10github/FInalProject/blob/main/ProjectTechnicalReport.pdf)
